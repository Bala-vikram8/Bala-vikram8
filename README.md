## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Retail Theft Analysis in Chicago](https://github.com/Bala-vikram8/Retail_Theft_Analysis_Chicago)
   - Analyzed 24 years of retail theft data from Chicago to identify crime patterns, high-risk zones, store vulnerabilities, and arrest likelihood and built predictive models to forecast future incidents.
   - Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Prophet, TensorFlow), Geospatial tools (Folium, KMeans), and Tableau for end-to-end analysis. Applied ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM for forecasting. Developed classification models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost for predictive insights.
   - Identified key theft trends, built an interactive Tableau dashboard, and proposed zero-cost, high-impact recommendations for retailers and law enforcement. This project enhanced my EDA, machine learning, and storytelling skills — and prepared me for real-world analyst roles.


### 🔹 [Predictive Analytics for Driver Safety & Risk Management](https://github.com/Bala-vikram8/driver-safety-analysis)
   - Processed and analyzed **337K+ safety event records** to detect **driver risk patterns**.
   - Developed **machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)** achieving **90% accuracy**.
   - Conducted **geospatial analysis (K-Means clustering, Folium heatmaps)** to reduce accident-prone areas by **30%**.
   - Designed **interactive dashboards in Tableau, Power BI** for data visualization.

### 🔹 [Dynamic Insights into U.S. Unemployment Trends](https://github.com/Bala-vikram8/us-unemployment-analysis)
   - Developed an **integrated Tableau dashboard** to analyze **historical and current U.S. unemployment trends**.
   - Applied **time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, seasonal decomposition)** to predict unemployment rates **through 2030**.
   - Created **interactive maps, trend lines, and scatter plots** for data-driven policy decision-making.
